  "testimonials.reviews.jacosteph": "A good time. We entered by chance and had a wonderful time. The lamb tagine with pear and almond was exemplary. A very good moment.",
  "testimonials.reviews.p45560": "Great discovery. We were stranded... the restaurant where I wanted to have dinner had been closed for... several years. We walked without really knowing where to go. A friend had the fabulous idea of checking the internet to find an open oriental restaurant. So we called Pure Passion very late and they welcomed us after 10pm. We discovered a Moroccan cuisine full of flavor and a very warm welcome. For sure, we'll come back and we'll spread the word. Happy New Year to Pure Passion.",
